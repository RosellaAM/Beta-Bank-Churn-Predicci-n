Beta Bank faces the challenge of gradually losing customers month after month. This project develops a machine learning predictive model to identify customers with a high probability of leaving the bank (churn). The main objective is to create a classification model that maximizes the F1-score (with a minimum required value of 0.59) and complements the analysis with the AUC-ROC metric for comprehensive performance evaluation.

The project follows a structured methodology including data loading and exploration, preprocessing, class imbalance analysis, balancing techniques, parameter tuning, and final model evaluation.

## üéØ Project Results
The project has successfully developed a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying customers with high probability of leaving the bank. After an exhaustive process, we achieved a model that exceeds the initial target:
* **F1-score**: 0.593 (exceeding the 0.59 target).
* **AUC-ROC**: 0.87
* **Model Precision**: 87% area under the ROC curve.

## üöÄ Business Impact
* Early identification of at-risk customers
* Proactive and personalized retention strategies.
* Resource optimization by focusing efforts on high-probability churn customers.
* Tangible reduction in churn rate and increased retention revenue.
* Improved customer satisfaction through preventive attention.

## üéØ Core Skills
* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, categorical variable encoding, feature scaling.
* **Exploratory Analysis**: Class imbalance identification, distribution analysis.
